## Introduction ##

The name of this game is "Escaping Bats: Gotham Edition". It was individually designed and implemented using Python with Processing 3. 

The main aim of this project was to systematically develop a mini-game using the programming methods introduced in-class. In essence, it is a drop and catch game.

In this README.md file, I am going to dive into the Game Design and Game Implementation.

## Game Design ##

### Scenario ###

- Drop and Catch Game​
- Batman needs to avoid getting hit by the bats and the ground.​
- If he collides with a bat or the ground three times, the game will end.
